When I have nothing in the inventory show that I have nothing. Not list 5 empty items

Again if I wnat to sell wihtout anything in my inventory say so.

Do a time out if you can. What if the user chooses no option

Explain about the anagram

Add a line saying since its blind item...you will know what you won after the bid

Same list only the items we have won.. refine the number of the item I want to sell

So refine the statement about being thrown out of the auction
